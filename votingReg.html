                Federal and state elections in the United States are run by the states themselves, according to Article I and Article II of the Constitution. No two states run their elections exactly the same, so contacting your state or local election office is the best way to find out about your state’s unique election rules.</p>

                <br>• Most states assign you a specific polling place, or voting location. A few states have ballot drop sites instead.</br>
