        <h2>ROLE OF THE SENATE</h2>
            <p1 id = "senate">The Senate is one of the two houses in the United States Congress, the legislative branch of 
            the American government. Their power is established in Article One of the U.S. Constitution, which allows 
            the house to create and pass bills [which are passed to the president to sign into laws], as well as confirm
            the appointment of Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, federal executive officials, military officers, regulatory 
            officials, ambassadors, and other federal uniformed officers. Each state elects two senators, who each serve six-year
            terms, to represent the people. Their terms are staggered into three classes, so that approximately one third of the Senate
            seats are up for election every two years. The Senate currently holds a Republican majority and Democratic minority
            with 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents.</p1>
            
        <h2>LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE</h2>
            <p1 id = "lead">The presiding officer of the Senate, or the Vice President, is Mike Pence. His role is to supervise the Senate 
            on ceremonial occasions and to make the tie-breaking vote when the Senate is trying to pass or veto a bill. However, he 
            cannot vote in any other circumstances. He is on the ballot with the president during the presidential election every four 
            years and is next-in-line for the presidency. The Majority and Minority Leaders are Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Schumer 
            (D-NY) respectively. They are the spokespeople and representatives for their respective parties and are voted for by their 
            respective parties during the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Senate Republican Conference. The Majority and Minority Whips 
            are John Cornyn (R-TX) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) respectively. They gather votes from their party members on major issues and 
            ensure party discipline in the legislature. They are also voted on by their party.
