        <h2>ROLE OF THE HOUSE</h2>
            <p1 id = "house">The House of Representatives is one of the two houses in the United States Congress, the legislative branch of the American government. 
                Their power is established in Article One of the U.S. Constitution, which allows the house to pass federal legislation, although it must also be 
                approved by the Senate and the President before it officially becomes a law, as well as impeach federal officials for treason, bribery, or other 
                high crimes and misdemeanors. The House has committees and subcommittees to review bills and oversee the executive branch. The entire House makes 
                the appointment of committee members, but the choice of members is made by their respective political parties. Each state is allowed to elect a certain 
                number of representatives that is proportional to the state’s population, and each state is entitled to at least one. Representatives serve two-year terms. The 
                Senate currently holds a Republican majority and Democratic minority with 236 Republicans and 193 Democrats.</p1>
        <h2>LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE</h2>
            <p1 id = "lead">The current Speaker of the House is Paul Ryan. The speaker is elected by the House of Representatives and acts as its leader through the 
                combined roles of presiding officer and administrative head of the House, leader of the majority party in the House, and the representative role as 
                an elected member of the House. The Speaker of the House is second-in-line to succeed the President, after the Vice President. The Majority and Minority 
                Leaders are Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) respectively. Their positions are similar to that of the Senate, where they are the spokespeople 
                and representatives for their respective parties, as well as advocates for their party’s objectives and agenda. They are voted on by the House of 
                Representatives. The Majority and Minority Whips are Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Steny Hoyer (D-MD) respectively. They gather votes from their party 
                members on major issues and keep track of the attendance of the legislature when representatives vote. They are also voted on by their party.
