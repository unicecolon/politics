            As citizens of the United States, it is our civic duty to vote for our representatives. Our country fought the Revolutionary War for an
            independent, democratic nation-state and to ensure that its citizens would have the privilege of voting. However, young citizens' vote turnout
            is now at an all-time low. Young people, ranging from ages 18-29, make up 21% of the voting eligible population. In the 2016 election, only 50% of the
            young voting population went out to vote. We created this page to inform teenagers and young adults about Congress and the upcoming 2018
            midterm elections, in hope that they will pay more attention to what our government is doing in service of its citizens and go out to vote during the 
            elections.
